## Quickstart

npm start

# Runs the app in the development mode.
# Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
# The page will reload if you make edits.

npm run build

# Builds the app for production to the `build` folder
# It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimises the build for the best performance.
# The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
```
